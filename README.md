# Java-Print-Statement
A very basic program written in java to display a message using a Print Statement. This program is to accompany a tutorial video showing how to write, compile, and run code using the Java language

NOTE: This is only the written code, this will need to be compiled on your system first. Please see my tutorial video on my youtube channel with full instructions, or see below for a quick guide...

Open a command terminal (CTRL + ALT + T on Linux, search CMD on Windows),
Navigate to the directory/folder containing this java program (PrintMessage.java)
Compile the program using this command:

  ~$ javac PrintMessage.java
  
If all is good (no errors returned) then you are ready to run the program from the terminal using:

  ~$ java PrintMessage
  
The output should be displayed within the terminal. You can go ahead and edit the text by opening the PrintMessage.java file within your favorite editor (I use Geany) and personalise the output to your requirements.
